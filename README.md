# Final project for Web Development II Class- Web portfolio


## About my process, challenges and learnings:
To develop my portfolio, I wanted to create a simple and clean design that was easy to read and compelling at the same time. However, I quickly realized that I was constraining myself too much and not considering the potential for animations and other design elements to enhance the aesthetic appeal of my portfolio. After exploring these options, I feel confident that the animations I ultimately chose for my main text and links align well with my design and professional identity.

Additionally, I learned the importance of planning ahead for how to present my design projects and images in a way that accurately conveys the work I have done. This helped me to ensure that my portfolio effectively communicates my skills and capabilities as a UI designer.

## Credits
- All images are my own creation and the designer mentioned in the detail page, *Juan Camilo Quintero.*
